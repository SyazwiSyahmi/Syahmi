## Greetings
Hello, my name is Syazwi Syahmi Bin Abd Malik. I am currently pursuing Degree in Bachelors of Creative Multimedia specialized in Media Arts at Multimedia University Cyberjaya. 
I was born on 10th February 1996.  So in 2018, I am currently 22 years old.
When I was pursuing Foundation of Creative Multimedia, I learned the basic skills in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Since then, I have been exposed to other software, projects and exhibitions.
## Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop
These are screenshots of my side projects. It's just something that I do on my own for other uses.

## Processing
I have learned Processing, an Open-Source visual coding with many other possibilities. 
## Processing Projects
This was a project when I was in pursuing Degree in Media Arts. 
It was a project in Media Arts 4. The theme is to (Re)Mediate Artworks.
