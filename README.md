## Greetings
Hello, my name is Syazwi Syahmi Bin Abd Malik. I am currently pursuing Degree in Bachelors of Creative Multimedia specialized in Media Arts at Multimedia University Cyberjaya. 
I was born on 10th February 1996.  So in 2018, I am currently 22 years old.
When I was pursuing Foundation of Creative Multimedia, I learned the basic skills in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Since then, I have been exposed to other software, projects and exhibitions.

## Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop
These are screenshots of my side projects. It's just something that I do on my own for other uses.

## Icon Side-Project 
## (Gaming)
This Icon is kind of my own purposes. I wanted an icon for myself as a gamer. So I designed it like so. The image above was taken as reference as well as the elements that 'mixed' up into.

## (Hobby)

These are kind of the things I would do in my free time. I used to love Anime and Mangas since their drawings are so interesting and unique. I kind of do Line Arts during my foundation as my hobby. I still do from time to time, just not as often. I don't show them to others as much either. So I didn't want anyone to know much. It's an embarassing side of me.
